# Termination Notice

**For years we were trying to keep Ukey1 up and running with the vision of providing more secure free authentication for wide range of applications. Secure and stable authentication gateway needs great infrastructure which unfortunately costs money. Most of expenses we were covering with AWS credits, however those credits are going to expire soon. Since we only have limited time to take care of Ukey1 and since we cannot keep the original vision of constantly improving service following latest security trends, we did have to make a hard decision. Because of that Ukey1 terminates its operation on 1th June 2020.**
