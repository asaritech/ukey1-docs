## <a name="q1"></a>Do I need to have Terms and Privacy Policy on my website?

If your website serves for public audience (it means the app is not intended for internal purposes of the company), then yes, you have to.

## <a name="q2"></a>Are there any limitations or capacity quotas at Ukey1?

No, we don't limit your app. It's up to you how many users do you have - we don't charge anything for that.

Of course, if your API requests are suspicious, we can temporarily ban the access or limit the throughput through Cloudflare. Cloudflare also use its own measures to protect the network against DDoS attacks, so it may happen that there will show some limitations. But if you're using our API in common way, everything will be probably fine.

One more thing... Please note we are a startup with limited sources, so even if our infrastructure is scalable and grows with needs, it's not currently possible for us to grow fast to infinity. We intend to grow organicly rather than quickly. If you like it and want to grow with us, excellent!
